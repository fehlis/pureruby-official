[Project Status]
Goal = Generate a personal webpage for "PureRuby".
Progress = Completed initial page with 'About Me' section. Added three new sections: a live Twitter feed, a styled link to the Instagram profile, and a static summary of Exophase gaming achievements.

[TODO]
1 = deploy webpage using github / netlify
2 = Add a "Support Me" Section (Patreon/OnlyFans)
4 = Create a Unified "Socials" Hub (Twitter/Instagram/TikTok)
5 = (Advanced) Redesign into a "Dashboard" Layout

[Guidelines]
Ensure all theme style CSS files (e.g., style-original.css, style-retro.css) are updated in future edits to maintain consistency across themes.
